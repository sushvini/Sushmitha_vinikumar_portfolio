# 👩‍🔬 Sushmitha Vinikumar – Scientific Research Portfolio

Welcome to my research portfolio! I’m a materials scientist and microfluidics researcher with a background in nanoscience, smart surfaces, and interfacial fluid dynamics. My PhD thesis explores fluid phenomena on intrinsically charged surfaces (lithium niobate), with applications in biosensors and antibacterial coatings.

This portfolio showcases my research, code, data visualization, and innovation projects.
